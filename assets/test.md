Read the **README** to understand how to make your own posts. When you're ready, delete this one!

This is a markdown image tag that automatically creates a thumbnail.

[![Thom and Jonsi](thumbs/example.jpg?small)](images/example.jpg)

**Code:**

	[![Thom and Jonsi](thumbs/example.jpg?small)](images/example.jpg)

*Tip:* by adding `imgleft` or `imgright` to the tag's `alt` text, the image will wrap itself around text.

And now, a second example that use the PHPTextPost's markdown image aligning trick:

[![imgleft](thumbs/example.jpg?medium)](images/example.jpg) Now, the text will now wrap around it

**Code:**

	[![imgleft](thumbs/example.jpg?small)](images/example.jpg)
